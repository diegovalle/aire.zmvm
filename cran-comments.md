## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the LICENSE file for the BSD_3_clause

* Added more small executable examples in the Rd-files (some functions depend on an 
  internet connection so it wasn't possible)

## Test environments
* Ubuntu 16.04 locally, R 3.4.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis CI), R 3.4.2
* Windows Server 2016 & 2012 R2 (on AppVeyor), R 3.4.2
* Win-Builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs
1 NOTE because it is a new submission
