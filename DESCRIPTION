Description: The Mexico City government maintains a network of sensors to
    continually monitor air pollution, wind and temperature. This package provides R functions 
    for downloading the daily maximum, minimum, hourly average, or real-time data for each
    of the pollution measuring stations or geographic zones. It also contains the
    locations of each of the stations. See <http://aire.cdmx.gob.mx/> for more information.
